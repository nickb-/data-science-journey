# data-science-journey
There are no shortage of "intro to machine learning" blogs out there. Some are great! Most of them are reasonably straight-forward analyses of a dataset, using standard modelling approaches. Very few of them dig deeper and extend beyond these initial analyses.

Our goal in this repo is to do just that. We'll walk through the analysis of a dataset. We'll begin with a relatively straight forward baseline machine learning model, and then we'll extend this. We'll go through a number of different iterations, each one building on the earlier efforts. 

As we go, we'll attempt to improve the predictive accuracy of our baseline model, we'll look at inference (understanding our predictions), cover uncertainty (using Bayesian methods) and finally we'll look at what it takes to put this into the hands of non-data-science users by integrating predictions with both historical and simulated examples.
